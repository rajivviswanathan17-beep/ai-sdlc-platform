# PRD Workflow Guide

> Complete guide to creating world-class Product Requirements Documents using AI assistance

## 🎯 Overview

The PRD (Product Requirements Document) workflow is the foundation of your AI-driven SDLC process. This guide walks you through creating comprehensive, stakeholder-aligned PRDs that serve as the blueprint for everything that follows.

## 🏗️ PRD Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Project Initialization (15 minutes)
- Project setup and stakeholder identification
- AI-guided discovery questionnaire
- Industry template selection
- Success criteria definition

### Stage 2: AI-Assisted Content Generation (1-2 hours)
- Market analysis and competitive research
- User persona and journey mapping
- Feature prioritization and specification
- Technical considerations and constraints

### Stage 3: Collaborative Refinement (2-4 hours)
- Multi-stakeholder review and feedback
- Content iteration and enhancement
- Cross-functional alignment validation
- Final approval and sign-off

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Project Setup

#### Access the PRD Workshop
1. **Navigate to Projects**: Click "New Project" from the main dashboard
2. **Select Template**: Choose from industry-specific PRD templates
3. **Basic Information**: Enter project name, description, and key stakeholders

#### AI Discovery Interview
The AI will guide you through a series of adaptive questions:

```
🤖 AI Assistant: "Let's start with understanding your product vision. 

What problem are you trying to solve for your users?"

💭 Your Response: "Small businesses struggle to track their customer relationships effectively without expensive CRM systems."

🤖 AI Assistant: "That's a clear pain point. Who specifically experiences this problem? Can you describe your target user?"

💭 Your Response: "Small business owners with 10-50 customers who currently use spreadsheets or sticky notes."

🤖 AI Assistant: "Perfect. Now, what would success look like for these users after using your solution?"
```

**Pro Tip**: Be specific in your responses. The AI uses this information to generate relevant content throughout the PRD.

### Step 2: Template Selection & Customization

#### Available Templates
- **B2B SaaS Platform**: Multi-tenant applications with subscription models
- **Consumer Mobile App**: iOS/Android applications with user engagement focus
- **E-commerce Platform**: Online retail with payment and inventory systems
- **Enterprise Software**: Internal tools with complex workflows and integrations
- **FinTech Application**: Financial services with regulatory compliance
- **HealthTech Platform**: Healthcare applications with privacy requirements

#### Template Customization
```yaml
# Example template configuration
template_config:
  industry: "b2b_saas"
  complexity_level: "medium"
  compliance_requirements: ["gdpr", "soc2"]
  integration_needs: ["stripe", "salesforce", "slack"]
  user_base_size: "1000-10000"
  technical_stack: "modern_web"
```

### Step 3: AI-Generated Content Review

#### Executive Summary Generation
The AI analyzes your inputs and generates:

    B --> G[Needs Revision]
    C --> G
    D --> G
    G --> A
```

#### Quality Validation
The AI continuously validates your PRD for:
- **Completeness**: All required sections filled
- **Consistency**: No conflicting requirements
- **Clarity**: Clear, unambiguous language
- **Feasibility**: Technically achievable goals
- **Measurability**: Quantifiable success criteria

### Step 5: Content Enhancement & Optimization

#### AI Writing Assistant Features
As you write, the AI provides:
- **Smart suggestions**: Context-aware content recommendations
- **Gap identification**: Missing information alerts
- **Consistency checking**: Terminology and tone alignment
- **Best practice integration**: Industry-standard approaches
- **Competitive intelligence**: Market insights and positioning

#### Example Enhancement Suggestions
```
💡 AI Suggestion: "Your user persona section mentions 'small business owners' but doesn't specify industry verticals. Consider adding:
- Professional services (lawyers, accountants)
- Retail businesses (local shops, restaurants)  
- Service providers (contractors, consultants)

This will help with marketing targeting and feature prioritization."

💡 AI Suggestion: "Your success metrics focus on acquisition and retention, but consider adding operational efficiency metrics:
- Average time to close a deal
- Customer data completeness rate
- User task completion rate

These will help validate your 'simplicity' value proposition."
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: AI generates generic content
**Solution**: Provide more specific inputs during discovery interview
```
❌ Generic: "Build a better user experience"
✅ Specific: "Reduce customer onboarding time from 2 weeks to 2 days by automating account setup and providing interactive tutorials"
```

**Issue**: Stakeholders can't agree on requirements
**Solution**: Use the conflict resolution workflow
```javascript
const conflictResolution = {
  method: "weighted_voting",
  stakeholders: [
    {name: "Product Owner", weight: 0.4},
    {name: "Engineering Lead", weight: 0.3}, 
    {name: "Customer Success", weight: 0.3}
  ],
  decision_threshold: 0.6
};
```

**Issue**: PRD is too technical/not technical enough
**Solution**: Adjust audience settings
```yaml
audience_configuration:
  primary: "business_stakeholders"  # or "technical_team"
  technical_detail_level: "medium" # low/medium/high
  jargon_level: "minimal"          # minimal/moderate/extensive
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

After completing your PRD:
1. **Proceed to NFR Analysis**: Transform business requirements into technical specifications
2. **Begin Design Phase**: Create user experience designs aligned with your requirements
3. **Set Up Tracking**: Configure success metrics monitoring
4. **Plan Iterations**: Schedule regular PRD reviews and updates

**Pro Tip**: The quality of your PRD directly impacts the quality of everything that follows. Invest time in this phase for exponential returns later.
