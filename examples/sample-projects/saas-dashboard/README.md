#### Sample User Story (AI-Generated)

```gherkin
**Story Title:** Real-time MRR calculation and display
**Story ID:** DASH-007
**Epic:** Dashboard Core
**Story Points:** 5

**User Story:**
As a SaaS founder, I want to see my Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) updated in real-time so that I can track business growth and make informed decisions quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Given I am logged into the DataFlow Analytics dashboard
When I view the main dashboard
Then I should see the current MRR prominently displayed

Given new subscription data is received from Stripe
When the data is processed
Then the MRR should update within 30 seconds
And I should see a visual indicator of the change (up/down arrow with percentage)

Given I hover over the MRR metric card
When I hover for more than 2 seconds
Then I should see a tooltip showing:
- MRR breakdown by plan type
- Month-over-month growth percentage
- Trend data for the last 12 months

Given the MRR calculation fails due to data issues
When the error occurs
Then I should see a clear error message
And the system should log the error for investigation
And the previous valid MRR value should remain displayed

**Technical Requirements:**
- Real-time WebSocket connection for live updates
- Stripe webhook integration for immediate data sync
- Redis caching for performance optimization
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Responsive design for mobile devices

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Unit tests covering all calculation logic (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for Stripe webhook processing
- [ ] Performance tests ensuring sub-30-second updates
- [ ] Accessibility testing for screen readers
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated for API endpoints
- [ ] QA testing completed with sign-off
```
