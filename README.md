# AI-Driven SDLC Collaboration Platform

> Revolutionizing software development through intelligent human-AI collaboration

## 🎯 Overview

The AI-Driven SDLC Platform transforms traditional software development by automating and enhancing each stage of the development lifecycle. From initial product requirements to development-ready user stories, this platform leverages advanced AI to accelerate delivery while maintaining quality and stakeholder alignment.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔄 Three-Stage Workflow
1. **PRD Generation**: AI-assisted Product Requirements Document creation with collaborative editing
2. **NFR & Design Studio**: Technical requirements analysis and UI/UX design generation
3. **User Story Hub**: Convert PRDs, NFRs, and designs into development-ready user stories

### 🤖 AI-Powered Capabilities
- **Intelligent Content Generation**: Context-aware PRD sections, technical requirements, and user stories
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user editing with live cursors and commenting
- **Quality Validation**: Automated completeness, consistency, and feasibility checking
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI recommendations for improvements and missing elements

### 🔗 Enterprise Integrations
- **Development Tools**: Jira, GitHub, Linear, Azure DevOps
- **Communication**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord
- **Design**: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD
- **Analytics**: Custom dashboards and success metrics tracking

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
